# Consuming Weather API with React
## The goal is to create a weather application using React. This app should provide users with real-time weather information, forecasts, and customization options.

## Requirements
### Core Features
### - Integrate with a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) to fetch current weather conditions, hourly, and daily forecasts.
### - Display current weather conditions (temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.).
### - Provide hourly and daily weather forecasts.
### - Allow users to set their location or automatically detect it.
### - Provide weather information for the user's current location.
### - Send push notifications for severe weather alerts in the user's location.
### - Allow users to customise the app's theme or display units (e.g., Celsius vs. Fahrenheit).
### - Make use of local storage for data persistence.
### - Optimise the app for fast loading and smooth performance.
### - Implement basic user authentication to protect user data.
### - Store passwords securely (e.g., hashing).
